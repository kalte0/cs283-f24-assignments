- Hallway, now with spiky balls!

Walking into the ball adds a point to your score. Every 3 points increases the player's level by 1.

- Demo of Player Movement and rigid camera.

Here, you can see that the Rigid Body Camera has been activated, and the Spring Camera has been deactivated. If instead, the Spring Camera is activated:

There are two additional major features:
1.  I have added mouse controls for the heading and pitch of the camera. However, I found this in addition to either camera controller to be kind of nauseating, so this is false by default, and can be toggled on in the unity object inspector.
2.  The camera object has a collider, which makes any object it collides with transparent, so that the camera is not obscured by other objects.

both of these features are displayed in the following clip:
