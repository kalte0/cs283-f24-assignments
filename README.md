- Hallway, now with spiky balls!

Walking into the ball adds a point to your score. Every 3 points increases the player's level by 1.

Assignment 5: Spring into Action

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75e1656f-ec66-45c6-ade9-c3964364b9fe
- Demo of Player Movement and rigid camera.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d65dc659-6a7d-400f-a43d-e5caeaf5a961)

Here, you can see that the Rigid Body Camera has been activated, and the Spring Camera has been deactivated. If instead, the Spring Camera is activated:

There are two additional major features:
1.  I have added mouse controls for the heading and pitch of the camera. However, I found this in addition to either camera controller to be kind of nauseating, so this is false by default, and can be toggled on in the unity object inspector.
2.  The camera object has a collider, which makes any object it collides with transparent, so that the camera is not obscured by other objects.

both of these features are displayed in the following clip:

Assignment 6: Bezier, Faster, Stronger

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d5ecc66-514b-4600-bcf3-0ffeb42644ae
- Linear path moving

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49eafbda-a0a5-4668-86d0-473a59687f0d
- Bezier curve path 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7188c8a-36f5-4a63-8c9e-e75a4cc5a202
- Simple IK (You'll notice some odd movement here. There's a bug where sometimes the limb will flip 180 degrees and face away from the target instead of toward it-- struggling to get rid of that!!)

For the gaze controller, a similar issue is happening. The head invariably points in the opposite direction of the target.
